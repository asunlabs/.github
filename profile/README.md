## :mag_right: A List of open source projects

### **PawCon-monorepo**

A playground for a blockchain development. This is my `main` side project that has longest time view, largest tech changes. I get my hands dirty here before `company work`. See [here](https://docs-pawcon.netlify.app/) for more details.

Using,

- React/Redux/TS
- Fiber/GORM
- Hardhat/Solidity
- Turborepo

Recommend to,

- who want to be a blockchain developer
- who gets their own hands dirty trying highly experimental blockchain features

### **Owlly**

A playground for a small-size startup `internal tool`. It started to solve a specific problem inspired by [codeshifu/sync-dotenv-slack](https://github.com/codeshifu/sync-dotenv-slack) and then broaden its domain to become BAAS(Binary as a service).

Using,

- Wails
- React/TS

### **MeowRun**

A playground for a unity 3D game development. This project is not actively maintained anymore.

Using,

- Unity
- Svelte/TS/Sass
- Express
