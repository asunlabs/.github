[I](https://github.com/developerasun) code some shits and archive everything here just like every other side projects died.

Here is a list of it.

- [Owlly](https://github.com/asunlabs/owlly): Dotenv slack notifier. Developed to solve config sharing in dev team.
- [AsunLabs](https://github.com/asunlabs/asunlabs): My web3 startup company. Developed for 4 month by myself. Gave up and backed to corporate job. Will try it out later again.
- [Learn-blockchain](https://github.com/asunlabs/learn-blockchain): Web3 snippets and research. Check issues tab to find some useful articles. 
- [Projects-monorepo](https://github.com/asunlabs/projects-monorepo): Smart contract snippets. 
- [MyCodeBox-monorepo](https://github.com/asunlabs/mycodebox-monorepo): CS research. Check issues tab to find some useful articles. 
- [Setup-template](https://github.com/asunlabs/setup-template): Personal code convention snippets.
- [Personal](https://github.com/asunlabs/personal): Personal music playist and TIL snippets.

I found that most of side projects I gave a shot had not been crafted except [this one](https://github.com/asunlabs/owlly) and just fell into abyss called 'meh let's not do it.'

The only side project it had fully been released with life cycle is that I made it to super tight schedule, which was two days, with very specific functionality.

For then next projects, I will try to release a MVP ASAP and re-develop from there.
